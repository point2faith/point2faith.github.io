In addition to Sunday School for all ages and Worship Service, we have our Awana and Youth Groups for children age 2 through 12th grade from 6:00pm to 7:30pm.  On Wednesday evening, at 7pm, we will be holding prayer meetings.  Please feel free to join us for any or all of the options as appropriate!
