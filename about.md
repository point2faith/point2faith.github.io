<p>The mission of Faith Baptist Church is to Obey God, Preach the Gospel, and Serve Othersâ€¦ in Commercial Point and all points beyond. We are an independent Baptist church, in fellowship with the Ohio Association of Regular Baptist Church and the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches.  We are pastored by Pastor Greg Lonsway, who God led to shepherd our congregation in September 2016. </p>
